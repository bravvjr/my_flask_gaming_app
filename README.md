Welcome to the Flask Gaming App! This is a web application built with Flask that allows users to browse gaming products, manage their cart, and interact with an admin dashboard for product and customer management. The app is designed for both users and administrators, with separate functionalities for each role.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja2 Templating
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Password Hashing**: Werkzeug Security
- **Environment Management**: `python-dotenv`

---

## Technical Features

1. **Modular Code Structure**:
   - The app is structured using Flask Blueprints for better organization and scalability.
   - Blueprints are used for `views`, `auth`, and `admin` functionalities.

2. **Secure Authentication**:
   - User passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` and verified using `check_password_hash`.
   - Flask-Login manages user sessions and authentication.

3. **Database Models**:
   - SQLAlchemy is used to define and manage database models (`Customer`, `Product`, `Cart`, `Order`).
   - Relationships between models (e.g., `Customer` to `Cart`, `Product` to `Order`) are implemented using SQLAlchemy's ORM.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Custom 404 error page for better user experience.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Sensitive configuration (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`) is managed using environment variables loaded from a `.env` file.

6. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Admins can perform CRUD operations on products and customers through a dedicated dashboard.

7. **Cart Management**:
   - Users can add/remove items from their cart, with cart data linked to their account.
